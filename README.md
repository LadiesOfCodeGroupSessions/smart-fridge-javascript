  Here are some ideas for tests

- adding items to the fridge (done)
- adding a scan timestamp to items when added (done)
- add item count tracking (done)
- removing items (done)
- when the fridge is empty the count will not go below 0
- working out time left on item before expiry
- opening the fridge and how it affects all items in fridge
